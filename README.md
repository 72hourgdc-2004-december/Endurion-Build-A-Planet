    Build a Planet


    This game is an entry for the 72 Hour Game Development Competition at Redemption.
    It requires Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP. A sound card is optional and highly recommended for high class 
    white noise sound effects.
    You start this at your own risk. I take no responsibilities whatsoever if something happens to your PC.


    The Gameplay:
    -------------
    You're a God. You are in dire need of more power. To gain power you need more worshippers. Worshippers
    need relicts. Luckily you've got yourself an avatar.

    Customize the world to your needs and help your hero to collect the relicts in the Caves of Despair. You can
    change the gravity, wind and light. But these not only affect your hero in his trusty balloon, but also
    the other inhabitants. With careful little customizations you can succeed!


    You customize the world with the buttons in the lower right corner.
    The top three buttons change the light of the sun.
    The lower three buttons change the gravity of the world itself.
    The arrow buttons modify the wind direction. Use those to move the avatar's balloon around (as the lazy
    bastard doesn't do a thing, just relying on you).
    The stop button in the middle of the arrow buttons stops the wind alltogether.

    Finally, the reset button on the left bottom will reset the current stage, so you can try again, if your
    avatar kicked the bucket.

    If you're really out of patience, you can press N to begin at the next stage. There's only 7, so you should
    really try. It ain't that hard.


    The Sourcecode:
    ---------------
    The full sourcecode plus a VS 2003 solution is included, so you can basically change the game as much as you
    want to. As long as you keep mentioning where you found the sourcecode and include a link to my homepage.

    The code itself isn't very clean and includes some ugly hacks, but i'm running out of time.
